While many recipes for adobo call for painstakingly peeling and slicing more than a dozen garlic cloves, we found that cutting open a whole head of garlic and simmering it in the sauce achieves the same delicious effect in a fraction of the time."

        "info" : "Leftover rice is ideal for this dish (and a great way to use up any takeout that’s hanging around), since fully chilled rice tends to be drier and will become crispier and browner in the skillet. To get the best texture, evenly distribute the rice in your pan and gently press down to flatten it out like a pancake. "
